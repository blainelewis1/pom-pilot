// TODO: integrate with spotify
// TODO: keyboard shortcuts

// TODO: "off track" button that logs to google calendar since the last time completed until now that you were off track. Or maybe even just "Back track" where you can label what you did during the last untracked time. maybe timer just automatically picks up the time since the last event? should backtrack go all the way to the last google calendar event or should it go to the last timer? What if there wasn't one?

// TODO: use a service worker for push notifications.

/** MORE DATA */

// TODO: add ability to track location of work by prompting where you are occasionally
// TODO: transparency (whether or not time is blocked.
// TODO: visibility, whether or not other people casn see the event.
// TODO: add meta data to event with some parseable syntax like ```{timesPaused:1}```

/** BUGS */

// BUG:  cancelling a POM might not result in something being pushed
// BUG: counts down too quickly in first second
// BUG: can't construct notification on mobile. This needs a better wrapper
// BUG: once I fix persisted state not using correct time elapsed then I need to limit when we give notifications...
// BUG: if you reload and an event was finished during closed time it errors because the auth isn't ready yet. I need to queue the request. Maybe check if the auth is enroute and add another then to it or something.

// TODO: deploy to github
// TODO: first time setup stuff (instructions etc.).
